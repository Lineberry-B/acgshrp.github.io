His siblings were Ruth Studebaker, Grace McBride, Robert Andress, Pearle McMillan, Vera Dusseau, and Donna Wilson. He went to and graduated from Hartford High School. Floyd enlisted into the United States Army on November 3, 1942. His enlistment was for the duration of the war plus six months afterwards. He was trained at Camp Wheeler, Georgia. He served in Africa, Sicily, and the Anzio beachhead as part of the Co. I, 7th Infantry, 3rd Division. Floyd Andress has earned the Purple Heart and the Combat Infantryman Badge. He had also received a citationfrom his company commander. In a letter to Floyd's parents about the citation the commander stated "Sergeant Andress has always exhibited fine leadership and personal courage. He is liked and respected by his squad, and has the confidence of all men in the company." His sister, Donna, went to Italy long after Floyd's death and received a certificate of honor made out to Floyd from the city of Anzio. Floyd Andress died on May 22, 1944 of wounds received in battle near Valmontone, Italy. His injuries were believed to have been received a few days before the fall of Rome. Floyd was originally buried in Italy, but his parents put in an application to have his body returned to the Oblong United States. Floyd J. Andress is now buried in the MRE cemetery in Berne, Indiana. For his service, Sergeant Andress received the American Theatre Campaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, and the WWII Victory Medal.
