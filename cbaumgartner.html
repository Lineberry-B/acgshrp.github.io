<h1>Baumgartner, Carl D.</h1>
<h2>PFC Carl D. Baumgartner</h2>
<p>Carl David Baumgartner was born on December 4th, 1919 in Corner French, Indiana. His father was Joe Baumgartner, and his mother was Viola Beitler. He grew up with seven older siblings: Esther Leotta, Russell Lawrence, Glenn Joseph, Anna Elizabeth, Roy Wilson, John Melvin, and Alice Mae; and two younger siblings: Dale Erskine and Don Harold. He was never married, and had no children. Carl, nicknamed "Bummy" at the time, went to high school for four years at Kirkland High School in Kirkland, Indiana. In his junior year, he was known as the powerhouse of the basketball team and an inspiration for everyone. He was also in the school's Farmers' Institute, although there is no information other than the fact that him and his brother participated. Carl enlisted in the army during World War II on May 15, 1942 in Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indianapolis, Indiana. At the time, he was 5'8" and weighed 155 pounds. He was a Private First Class in 395th Bombardment Group of the Army Air Corps. Although, he initially trained as a radio operator, after serving in the Panama Canal Zone and Mexico, he returned to the states to receive aircrew training on a B17. Unlike his brother Dale, Carl never made it past training before he died on August 18, 1943. His brother, PFC Dale Baumgartner, was killed in action in Germany on December 10, 1944. During a routine flight around Ardmore Air Force Base, Kansas; Carl and five others died in a crash. During the flight, a propeller "ran away," causing the plane to go out of control. In an attempt to fix this issue at a low altitude under 100 feet, the bomber belly-landed and slid into a ditch, killing the soldiers instantly. Afterwards, the plane caught on fire, burning the remains. Carl's remains were sent to Fort Benjamin Harrison, and a funeral was held at 1:30 P.M. on August 23, 1943 at the home of his parents, and at 2:00 P.M. at the Pleasant Dale Church of the Brethren. He was interred in the Pleasant Dale Cemetery in plot 292 in Pleasant Dale, Indiana. Information researched and collected by Grant Millington, 2015.</p>
