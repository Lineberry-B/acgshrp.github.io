<h1>Krick, Herman W.</h1>
<h2>Private Herman Willard Krick</h2>
<p>Herman W. Krick was born on the 6th of August 1913 to George Winfred Krick and Melinda E. Gause Krick. At this point in time he had one older sister, Dorothy A. Krick. After Herman, George and Melinda had six more children; Hubert E. Krick. (B. 19 Aug 1916), Helen Ione Krick (B. 31 Mar. 1919), Doyle H. Krick (B. 11 Oct. 1925), Eileen Krick (B. 30 Jun. 1930), Roger LeRoy Krick (Unknown), and Larry A. Krick (B. 4 Feb. 1946). Herman attended grammar school and held a job with a construction company before finally being drafted on the 27th of Jan. 1941. Herman and 27 other gentleman from Decatur were sent off to Fort Benjamin Harrison. Sadly, not long before the U.S. enters WWII, Herman was killed in a crash while two other men and himself were delivering motorcycles to a San Francisco base. He collided with the rear of a vehicle fracturing his skull and crushing his chest. He later died at the San Jose Hospital from these injuries. He was pronounced dead on the 31st of Aug. 1941. He was 28 when he died. Herman's body was escorted home by several other men from Adams County, IN. He was buried Sept. 1941 in the Decatur Cemetery. Information researched and collected by Trenton Kirchner, 2014.</p>
