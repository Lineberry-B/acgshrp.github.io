<h1>Jauregui, Ralph F.</h1>
<h2>Rank</h2>
<p>Ralph Jauregui was born in Pittsburgh, Oklahoma on February 15, 1920 to Mexican immigrants Teofill and Felicitas (Castellanas) Jauregui. Later that year his family moved to Decatur, Indiana later that year. Their family had moved to Decatur in hopes of finding a better job. A couple years later his older brother, Manuel Jauregui, got a home in Monroe as a beet worker. Here Ralph had attended school up until high school, having finished 8th grade when he started to work as well. His family moved in with his brother and lived there until 1940 when Ralph, his father, brother Lupe, and fianc√© Mildred Knittle moved into a house on 3rd street in Decatur. Here Ralph worked at General Electric until being laid off, but on the side he still worked at a beet farm. After marrying Mildred in 1941, they gave birth to their first daughter Patricia Marie. In the year 1943, Ralph was inducted into the Army on June 11. He entered service later that month on June 25. His training took place at Camp Wheeler in Georgia. Later that year in November he was sent overseas as part of the 34th Division 135th Infantry Regiment under Col. John Breit. Ralph was a Private and his service tag was 35556938. The division was part of the campaign moving north through Italy. Before arriving in Italy, German forces had been pushed back from the Volturno Line and Barbara Line. The next line was the Gustav Line, which had a strategic highway that ran through it. The British and Canadian Armed a Forces had secured Ortona in mid-December, which in turn made it easy for the U.S. to push forward. Then in January they made the movement forward towards Cassino. Monte Cassino was topped by an old monastery that would play a pivotal part in the battle. At the bottom of the mountain was Route 6, and this road was a straight shot to Rome. On January 24, the 34th Division passed the through the flowing Rapido River. They found themselves behind the town and moved into the hills fighting for eight days to gain some ground in the battle. The division then felt they weren't getting anywhere, so they changed their plans and fought their way through the mountains towards the abbey in early February. The Division fought for multiple days before finally withdrawing on February 11. During the battle sometime on February 8 Ralph Jauregui and few others in his company were declared missing in the effort to take the mountain on which the abbey was on top of. Later that month, the Division bombed the abbey, which is considered one of the most controversial parts of the war, because they believed they saw German troops inside the abbey. Both sides had agreed not to attack the abbey because they wanted to reserve it for its history, but the U.S. claimed the Germans were inside which violated their agreement. After the battle, Ralph's remains would be recovered and temporarily interred in Italy before being brought back to Decatur, where he was interred in the Saint Joseph Cemetery. Ralph is survived by his many brothers and sisters who all moved away from the area, and wife Mildred and daughter Patricia. For his service in the Army he received the European Campaign Medal, the Purple Heart, the American Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal.
