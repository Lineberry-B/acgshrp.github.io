<h1>Tricker, Jack L.</h1>
<h2>SGT. Jack L. Tricker</h2>
<p>Jack Lemoyne Tricker was born on July 21st, 1921 in Decatur, Indiana. His parents were Elmer and Grace Tricker. He was the second youngest in his family, with two older brothers Richard and Kenneth, two older sisters Sharon and Maxine (who died as a child), and a younger sister Betty. Jack attended Decatur High School and graduated with the class of 1939. He participated in the school play that year "Growing Up", and was also a cheerleader. His senior year yearbook described him as "having the talking part of the senior play", and that Jack "possessed the best lung stamina and acrobatic qualities...". Shortly after graduating high school he moved up north with his family to the town of Sturgis, Michigan, where he became a clerk. When war broke out, Jack enlisted into the Army Air Corps in Kalamazoo Michigan on September 23, 1942. Upon completion of basic training, he was assigned to B-17 42-5112, otherwise known as the "Dixie Flyer" as an aerial gunner. Jack served in the 543rd Bombardment Squadron, 383rd Bomb Group. The 543rd Bombardment Squadron was a training unit in World War II. Upon completion of basic flight training, trainees were transferred to the 383rd Bombardment Squadron for advanced training. And when airmen successfully completed advanced training, they moved on to the 313th Bombardment Wing who would go on to lead bombing missions over Japan, bombing the Japanese controlled islands of Iwo Jima and the Truk islands. They also blockaded mining harbors in enemy territory during the war. They also bombed airfields containing kamikaze planes during the Battle of Okinawa. Jack Tricker was killed on M y 22, 1943 as a Staff Sergeant. He died during an evening training mission when his plane crashed near Rapid City, South Dakota. No one knew what happened to his plane that caused it to wreck. His remains were sent over to Sturgis, Michigan for a funeral held by the American Legion and would later be buried in Decatur, IN. For his service, SSgt. Tricker earned the American Campaign Medal and the WWII Victory Medal. Information researched and collected by Luke Spannan, 2016.</p>
