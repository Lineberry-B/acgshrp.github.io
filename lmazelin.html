<h1>Mazelin, Lester J.</h1>
<h2>TSGT. Lester J. Mazelin</h2>
<p>Lester J. Mazelin was born on December 4, 1918, in Monroe Indiana. His parents were David J. and Mary Mazelin. He was the only boy in his family and had four sisters. Lester was a resident of Monroe, Indiana. He joined the Army on June 30, 1941, and was sent overseas on April 29, 1942. Mazelin spent his time working in a factory at the Wayne Novelty plant located in Decatur before he was sent overseas. Before that, he had attended Monroe High School. Lester as a child also went to Sunday school at the Mennonite church. Upon his enlistment, he was assigned to the 34th Infantry Division and the 135th Infantry Regiment. He was part of the cannon company. His training took place at Fort Sill, Oklahoma; Camp Claiborne, Louisiana; Fort Barrancas, Florida; and Fort Dix, New Jersey. On April 29, 1942, Lester was sent overseas to Ireland. The 34th Division fought in both North Africa and Italy. The division was first sent to Ireland where they trained for battle. They then were sent to North Africa to help with the allied invasion. The 34th participated in the Battle of Tunisia in November 1942. The Battle of Tunisia was the first action the division had seen. They later were sent to Italy to fight and help with the efforts there. Lester J. Mazelin was killed in action on Saturday, July 15, 1944 near the Italian town of Castelnuevo. The 135th Infantry had just secured Rosignano, Italy and were moving to capture and secure Leghorn when they encountered Nazi SS. Securing the port of Leghorn would be crucial to future operations in Italy and the Southern coast of France. As stated in a newspaper article, Lester saw more action than most Adams County soldiers. Mazelin participated in both the Italian and African campaigns during WWII. A friend of Lester named Max wrote home and explained what had happened to Lester Lester and a small group of men went ahead in order to find a new position. Once they had found a position they informed the rest of the company to join them. As they waited three shells hit them and the bursts killed all six individuals. The blast had hit him in both the heart and the arm. As stated by Max, Lester never knew what hit him. Lester is buried in the Florence American Cemetery in Italy. For his service, TSgt. Lester Mazelin was awarded the Purple Heart, American Defense Campaign Medal, American Theatre Campaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, and the WWII Victory Medal. In addition, TSgt. Mazelin also earned the Combat Infantryman Badge for action in North Africa and Italy. Information researched and collected by Josh Brown, 2016.</p>
