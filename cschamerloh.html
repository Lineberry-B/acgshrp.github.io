<h1>Schamerloh, Carl W.A.</h1>
<h2>Private Carl W.A. Schamerloh</h2>
<p>ABorn as Karl Wilhelm Adolf Schamerloh, Carl Schamerloh was the son of Mr. And Mrs. Edwin Schamerloh of the Union Township in Adams county. He was born June 9, 1920 in the Union Township on the family homestead off of Decatur route five. He attended Emanuel Lutheran school and was a member of Immanuel Lutheran Church: Missouri Synod. He spend much of his early life working on his fathers farm tending to anything from crops to the livestock. He was later employed at the General Electric company in Fort Wayne. While working at General Electric Carl began courting the woman he would later marry, Leona Wefel. Leona was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Otto Wefel who lived on 512 North Fifth street, they were married November 23, 1941. Almost a year later Carl made the honorable decision to enroll in the military, officially entering service on November 17, 1942. Carl was shipped off to Camp Wheeler, Georgia soon after enlistment. After his training he was sent off to North Africa with the fifth army to retake Africa from the Germans. Carl was assigned to the Third Infantry Division. Over the course of the war the third infantry, under the fifth army, was responsible for the liberation of the entire northern coast of Africa along with the retaking of fascist Italy from Mussolini. Individually, Carl's role in his outfit was the operation of an 88mm anti air gun. These guns were largely used as fortifications and rarely saw frontline combat, most were used as gun emplacements against enemy bombers. During Carl's service throughout the war he was awarded two awards for merit and achievement, the Combat Infantryman Badge and the Good Conduct Medal. The Combat Infantryman Badge was given to any serviceman who saw direct combat and willing put his life on the line in service to his country. The Good Conduct Medal is given to a service man with a perfect or clean record with no infringements or referrals, meaning Carl kept himself out of trouble and obeyed his commanders under every circumstance. Carl and the rest of the 3rd Infantry Division fought on through France during the D-Day invasion at Normandy. At this point in time, Carl was shot in killed pursuing German forces around Voray, France, September 9th 1944. During the war, 4,922 were killed in action and 18,766 wounded with a further 636 who died of wounds from the third division in total. Although temporarily buried at the U.S. Military Cemetery in St. Juan, France, Carl was eventually put to rest at his church, Immanuel Lutheran Church in Decatur Indiana.
