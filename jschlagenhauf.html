<h1>Schlagenhauf, John H.</h1>
<h2>Sargent John H. Schlagenhauf</h2>
<p>John H. Schlagenhauf was born October 27 1919 to George and Minnie Schlagenhauf. He attended Hartford High School and was a member of the class of 1937. He was inducted September 22, 1941 into the U.S. Army, and received basic training at Camp Wolters in Texas. Eventually earning the rank of Staff Sergeant, John served in an anti-tank company in the 105th Infantry. The 105th Infantry fought as part of the 27th Division in both world wars and is highly decorated for its actions in the battle of Saipan, where John Schlagenhauf was ultimately killed in action. The battle of Saipan was started June 15th 1944, and the goal was to take control of its crucial airbase from which the US could launch its B-29 bombers directly to Japan's home island. The US was successful in pushing the Japanese defenders to the Northern part of the island, that's when the Japanese began to launch a series of “banzai” charges against the US. In the battle of Saipan the 105th held the line against the final, and largest Japanese banzai charge in the battle and the war. The 105th kept the American effort on the island from collapsing. One of John's platoon members told how he died, “during the Japanese Banzai raid of July 7th 1944, John and his platoon held the line extending to the beach and the main Japanese attack was launched against them. John had spotted an American destroyer off the beach and tried to semaphore them for assistance. While standing on the beach signaling the destroyer, John was shot through the head by a Japanese sniper”. Two days later the Japanese were defeated and the US flag was raised on Saipan July 9th 1944.For their heroic actions defending against the attack, the 27th Division would be awarded a Presidential Unit Citation and three members of 105th Infantry Division would go on to earn the Medal of Honor for valor. Staff Sergeant John Schlagenhauf was originally buried in an Army Cemetery for the 27th Division in Hawaii, and was later moved to Old Salem Cemetery in Bluffton, Indiana. For his service, SSgt. Schlagenhauf was awarded the Purple Heart, American Campaign Medal, American Defense Ribbon, Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal. SSgt. Schlagenhauf also earned the Combat Infantryman Badge for combat service in Saipan. Information researched and collected by Austin Davison, 2016.</p>
