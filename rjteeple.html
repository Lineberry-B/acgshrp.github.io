<h1>Teeple, Richard J.</h1>
<h2>TECH SGT. Richard J. Teeple</h2>
<p>Richard J. Teeple was born on September 13, 1921, to Berneta Ann (Reynolds) Teeple and David H. Teeple, both deceased. Richard has many siblings, three sisters; Catherine Spiegel, Joyce ensign, and Marilyn Roop, and two brothers; Donald Teeple and Raymond Teeple. He graduated from Decatur Catholic High School. Richard joined the service on August 7th, 1942, in Toledo, Ohio, as a private in the army. He trained as a gunman at the Aerial Gunner School in Harlinger, Texas. Richard was a phenomenal student, placing fourth in his class. He attained the rank of Staff Sergeant as a testament to his excellence in school and was promoted to Technical Sergeant some time later. Richard was the chief engineer in the 313th bombing squad led by General Chennault's "China Liberators", and partook in over 50 missions. The sergeant was originally assigned a B-17 nicknamed the "Club Dub", but that was replaced by the B-24 "Trouble Maker" when they eventually crashed. Fortunately no one was hurt when the Club Dub crashed, but they wouldn't be that lucky DEATH Richard and his crew met an unfortunate end flying over China. They reported having a grotesque storm en route and were unable to avoid it. Part way through the storm communication with the crew was lost, and the plane was found crashed later Burma. The crew were to have been reported dead on May 28th, 1944. Everyone on the plane perished. Teeple was buried in the American vaults, but was later moved to his permanent resting place in Decatur Catholic Cemetery, where all of the last rites were held. Richard Teeple received many awards for his service, including the Purple Heart, the WWII Victory Medal, the American Campaign Medal, as well as the China Service medal, and most impressively, the Distinguished Flying Cross for "heroism or extraordinary achievement while participating in an aerial flight".
