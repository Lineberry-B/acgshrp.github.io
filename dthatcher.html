<h1>Thatcher, Delbert R. Jr.</h1>
<h2>PVT Delbert R. Thatcher</h2>
<p>Delbert Renold Thatcher Jr. was born on May 16th, 1923 in Spencerville Ohio. He is the son of Delbert Thatcher and Catharine (Banning) Thatcher. Delbert Jr’s father, Delbert Sr. worked at Yost Construction Company in Decatur Indiana. Delbert’s mother, Catharine was a stay at home mom who helped raise their 10 children. Delbert had four brothers (Preston, Alvin, Joseph, Eugene), and six sisters (Bonita, Wanita, Rose, Virgil, Mary, Marjorle). By 1940, the family moved to a farm house on Fredline Road in St. Mary’s township near Pleasant Mills. As a teenager, Delbert would work alongside his dad at Yost Construction Company in Decatur. Delbert also had a job as a farmhand at the family farm. In his teenage years, Delbert would attend Pleasant Mills High school for 3 years before joining the army. After 3 years of schooling, Delbert quit to join the United States Army. After leaving Pleasant Mills High school, Delbert Jr. volunteered for enlistment in the United States Army on August 26, 1943 in Toledo, Ohio. He enlisted for the duration of the war. After enlisting, Delbert was assigned to the enlisted reserve corps with the serial number of 35227364. After being transferred to the reserve corps, Delbert entered service on September 16, 1943. Once he entered service, he was assigned to Co. F, 329th Infantry, 83rd Division, and sent to several training camps including: Fort Harrison Indiana, Camp Van Dorn, Mississippi; and Camp Breckinridge Kentucky. At these camps, Delbert learned how to be an infantryman in the United States Army. After his training, Delbert Renold Jr. was sent overseas in April 1944. His division, the 83rd “Thunderbolt” Infantry Division, landed on Omaha Beach on June 18, 1944. After Delbert arrived in Normandy, France, he and his company fought near Carentan, and they saw action in the battle of Saint-Lô. The battle, which started on July 9 was part of Operation Overlord. “Operation Overlord” was the codename given for the Battle of Normandy. This battle lasted from June 6th 1944- August 30th 1944. The main point of the battle was to breach Hitler’s “Atlantic Wall”, and establish a point in mainland Europe to launch attacks against Germany. The battle of Saint-Lô was an important crossroad for the allies because all major roads ran through this town. During the battle, 95% of the town was destroyed due to bombardment. The 83rd Infantry Division was part of the VII Corps commanded by General Courtney Hodges. On July 9, 1944, Delbert’s division saw violent fighting near Périers, France. Eventually, the 83rd Division pushed past Périers, and took the town of St. Eny. On July 24th, 1944, the allies, and Delbert’s division captured the town of Saint-Lô. After fighting at Saint-Lô, the 83rd Division went on to fight in the Battle of the Bulge. Soon after the battle, the 83rd Division crossed the Rhine River, and captured the town of Halle. Later, on April 11, 1945, the “Thunderbolt” division liberated the Langenstein concentration camp. After encountering the camp, the 83rd gathered medical supplies and food for the prisoners. On July 9, 1944, Delbert Renold Thatcher Jr. was killed in action in Normandy, France. Delbert was interred temporarily at Ste. Mere Eglise, France. However, his brother, Preston, would request that his brother’s remains be brought back to the United States. Delbert Renold Thatcher Jr. was returned home on August 31, 1948 to Willshire, Ohio, where his brother lived at the time. Pvt. Thatcher is now interred in the Willshire Cemetery. For his service, Pvt. Thatcher earned the Combat Infantryman Badge, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, WWII Victory Medal, the Purple Heart, and the American Campaign Medal.
