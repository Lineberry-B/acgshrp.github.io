<h1>Sprunger, Wayne A.</h1>
<h2>PFC Wayne Sprunger</h2>
<p>Wayne Andrew Sprunger was born February 26, 1925, his parents were Andrew and Kate (Liechty) Sprunger. He didn't play any sports in high school and kept on the good side. He did his work and never was in trouble. Upon graduation from Berne High School, he became a trucker. He later heard that the army was taking volunteers to serve their country against the axis powers in World War II. Private First Class (PFC) Sprunger received medic training at Camp Barkley, Texas from November 7 to March 29 in 1944 and later at Camp Reynolds, Pennsylvania from March 29 to May 15, 1944. He would be assigned to the 121st Infantry, 3rd Army and sent overseas in March of 1945. While attached to the 3rd Army, PFC Sprunger participated in combat at Brest, Luxembourg, Dinard, Liberation of Paris, and the Ruhr District in Germany. The Ruhr District was the last battle he fought in. During this battle, PFC Sprunger attempted to save another soldier who had been wounded. During this attempt, Sprunger was shot in the back and died as a result on April 5, 1945 just a few weeks shy of V-E Day. For his act of heroism during the Ruhr battle, PFC Sprunger was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star, the nations fourth highest military award. Additionally, he was awarded the Purple Heart for his wounds resulting in death, the WWII Victory Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, and the American Campaign Medal. Private First Class Sprunger was temporarily buried in the U.S. Miiltary Cemetery at Margraten, Holland but was later moved to Berne, Indiana.
